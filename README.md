Install Node.js and NPM:
If the recipient doesn't have Node.js and NPM installed, they should do so by downloading and installing them from the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org/

Install Dependencies:
In the terminal or command prompt, they should navigate to the project directory and run the following command to install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
This command will read the package.json file and install the necessary packages listed in it.

Run the App:
Once the dependencies are installed, the recipient can run the Angular app using the following command:

bash
Copy code
ng serve
This command will build and serve the app locally. They can then open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200 to see the app in action.
